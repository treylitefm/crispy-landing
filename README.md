# Hermes

Hermes is a webapp that can be used to take screenshots of websites. The frontend is fairly modest, using a thin client composed of jquery and bootstrap. The backend is a bit more action-packed, leveraging Django, Flask, Postgres, Redis, and a full Selenium Grid. This project is deployed using docker compose and is ultimately an exercise in infrastructure "dockerization" and webapp backend architecture.
